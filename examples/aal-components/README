This is an example of using AAL preprocessor for splitting AAL models
into several files.

Test model for a system is constructed from a base model and included
components. The components are specified by preprocessor command line
arguments -Dcalc and -Dclock, given in the test configuration file.

Contents:

basesystem.aal
        
        This introduces and initialises variables needed by
        components. It includes component actions if corresponding
        preprocessor flag, "calc" or "clock" is defined.

clock.actions, calc.actions

        These files contain test step definitions for each of the
        components.

fullsystem.conf

        The test configuration file.
