This example demonstrates generating a set of offline tests with fMBT.

        generate-all-tests

                shell script that keeps generating tests as long as
                generated tests are "inconclusive" and they cover
                something that previously generated tests have not
                covered so far.

        weakly-connected.gt

                model which cannot be covered with a single test
                because executing any of iBranch actions reduces the
                set of actions that can be executed in the same test.

         weakly-connected.conf

                test configuration file. It defines that a test ends
                with verdict "inconclusive" if coverage has not
                increased since a past few actions (no_progress) or if
                generation cannot be continued due to all actions
                being disabled (deadlock).

                Changing permutation coverage parameter defines how
                many different action combinations the offline test
                suite will cover.


An offline test suite can be generated by executing

./generate-all-tests weakly-connected.conf


If you wish to restrict the length of individual generated tests to N
steps, add

inconc = "steps:N"

to the test configuration file.


The generate-all-tests script can be used for generating and executing
online tests, too. Configuration of the adapter needs to be added to
the test configuration file.
