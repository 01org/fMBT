This example tests filesystems by making and removing directories. It covers:

- successful mkdir
- successful rmdir
- successful mkdir of a subdirectory
- successful rmdir of a subdirectory
- mkdir failing because of non-existing parent directory
- mkdir failing because of already existing directory
- rmdir failing because of non-existing directory
- rmdir failing because of non-empty directory

After each operation, it is checked that directories that are expected
to exist are readable, and others are not.

filesystemtest.conf tests that all possible combinations of any two
operations are tested.

Edit the model and configuration:

$ fmbt-editor filesystemtest.aal filesystemtest.conf

Run the test:

$ fmbt -l test.log filesystemtest.conf

Run the test and see how it exercises the filesystem:

$ strace -e trace=mkdir,rmdir,access -f fmbt filesystemtest.conf >/dev/null
