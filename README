Building & installing
---------------------

Quick start for Debian (Ubuntu) users:
    (sudo) apt-get install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libboost-regex-dev libedit-dev python-pexpect python-dbus gawk

Quick start for Fedora users:
    yum install  glibc-devel glib2-devel boost-devel libedit-devel gcc-c++ pexpect dbus-python

./configure
make
make install

From fMBT sources you can build a normal version as above, and a
low-dependency "Android" version (./configure --enable-android): it
needs only C and C++ runtimes.


Documentation

Working on git source tree
--------------------------

Install autoconf and automake. Then build:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make


Testing
-------

make check
        Run tests against the source tree as it is.

test/git-HEAD/run.sh
        Run tests against the latest commit in the current git branch.
