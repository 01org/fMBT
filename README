Building & installing
---------------------

Quick start for Debian (Ubuntu) users:
    (sudo) apt-get install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libboost-regex-dev libedit-dev python-pexpect python-dbus gawk libtool autoconf automake 

Quick start for Fedora users:
    yum install  glibc-devel glib2-devel boost-devel libedit-devel gcc-c++ pexpect dbus-python libtool autoconf automake

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

From fMBT sources you can build a normal version as above, and a
low-dependency "Android" version (./configure --enable-android): it
needs only C and C++ runtimes.
