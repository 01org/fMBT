Building & installing
---------------------

Quick start for Debian (Ubuntu) users:
    (sudo) apt-get install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libboost-regex-dev libedit-dev python-pexpect python-dbus python-gobject gawk libtool autoconf automake debhelper libboost-dev flex libxml2-dev graphviz imagemagick gnuplot python-pyside

Quick start for Fedora users:
    yum install  glibc-devel glib2-devel boost-devel libedit-devel gcc-c++ pexpect dbus-python libtool autoconf automake flex libxml2-devel graphviz ImageMagick gnuplot

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

From fMBT sources you can build a normal version as above, and a
low-dependency "Android" version (./configure --enable-android): it
needs only C and C++ runtimes.


Documentation
-------------

doc/tutorial.txt - hands on with fMBT using a tiny example

doc/overview.txt - technical introduction on how fMBT works
                   in a real-life example

doc/models.txt   - how to create test models

doc/adapters.txt - how to use generic adapters and implement new ones


Building and using an Android version
-------------------------------------

1. Download and install Android NDK.

2. Run "./configure --enable-android --with-ndk-build=/your/ndk-build"

3. Run "make". This will build src/fmbt_droid targeted to your host.

4. Run "make src/android/fmbt_droid". This will build
   src/android/fmbt_droid targeted to Android.

Note: At the moment fmbt_droid contains a subset features of
fmbt. Most notably, it does not preprocess input files, handle regular
expressions in configuration files or fork and execute child
processes.


Testing
-------

make check
        Run tests against the source tree as it is.

test/git-HEAD/run.sh
        Run tests against the latest commit in the current git branch.
